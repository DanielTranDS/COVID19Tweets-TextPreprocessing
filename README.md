# COVID19Tweets-TextPreprocessing
Data Wrangling, Parsing text files and text preprocessing of Covid19 Tweets using Python

Parsing text files and text preprocessing of Covid19 Tweets

Text documents, such as crawled web data, are usually comprised of topically coherent text data, which within each topically coherent data, one would expect that the word usage demonstrates more consistent lexical distributions than that across data-set. A linear partition of texts into topic segments can be used for text analysis tasks, such as passage retrieval in IR (information retrieval), document summarization, recommender systems, and learning-to-rank methods.

In this project, there are 2 main tasks that I will carry out.

In the first task, I will extract data from a very large number of semi-structured text files, each contains thousand of tweets related to Covid19. Then I will transform the extracted data into XML format, following some pre-specified standards.

In the second task, it involves text pre-processing, in particular, preprocess a large amount of tweets and convert them into numerical representations (which are suitable for input into recommender-systems/ information-retrieval algorithms)
